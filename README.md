## Types of ML systems
1. **Supervised**
    1. **Regression**: predicts numeric value
    3. **Calassification**: predicts likelyhood of something belonging to some category
        4. Binary: in binary classification there are only two possible outcomes. ex. spam or not spam
        5. Multiclass: in multiclass classification there are more than two possible outcomes.
3. **Unsupervised: Model**: is given data that does not contain correct answer instead it employs technique called as clustering which creates grouping of the data. ex. private, public, work
4. **Reinforcement learning**: It learns by getting reward or penalties based on the action performed. ex. Self driving cars
5. **Generative AI**: creates content from user input

##

**Regression Model**:
1. Linear Regression: y = mx + b https://github.com/pravinvarma/tensorflowJS/blob/master/3x%2B1.html
2. Polynomial Regression: y = ax^2 + bx + c https://github.com/pravinvarma/tensorflowJS/blob/master/x%5E2%2B2x%2B1.html
3. Logistic Regression: y = 1 / (1 + e^(-z)) where z = wx + b

**Classification Model**:

2. Multiclass Classification: https://github.com/pravinvarma/ML/blob/main/load-rps-model.ipynb
